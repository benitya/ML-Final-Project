# ML-Final-Project
A project based on Disease Prediction using ML algorithms


The application of machine learning in disease prediction stands at the forefront of transformative advancements in healthcare. This research endeavors to address the critical need for early diagnosis in the context of disease prevention, with a specific focus on its potential impact on public health. The study centers on the exploration of disease prediction using the powerful framework of machine learning, employing the Support Vector Classification (SVC) algorithm. The research places a spotlight on the PIMA Indian diabetes dataset as a pivotal resource for investigating and modeling the predictive dynamics of diabetes.


Overhere we have calculated accuracies of various algorithms like raandom forest, XG Boost and SVC. We found out that SVC has the higgesst accuracy and is easy to implement.
